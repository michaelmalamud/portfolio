![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/michaelmalamud/portfolio2/main/images/page-screenshot.jpg)

## Context 
A website showcasing projects that I have worked on. 

## User
Users to this website would largely be potential employers who want to see past projects to determine my skill set. 

## Features
Mobile-responsive

## Technologies and Tools
HTML, CSS Flexbox

## Discoveries 
This project taught me a lot about how to get proper alignment with CSS Flexbox. 

## Future Goals
When I first built the site I didn't have all the featured projects finished. Consequently, some of the projects' links don't actually go anywhere. I intend to update the site so that all of the links actually lead to their corresponding projects.
