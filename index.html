           <h2>Hi, I'm Michael Malamud. </h2> 
           <p>I'm a software engineering student at Thinkful learning the full stack. I enjoy constantly growing my experience in JavaScript, React, and Node, as well as different uses of CSS. I'm located in Austin, TX.</p> 
        </section>
        <section id="about">
            <p>Developing is a constant challenge, and that's what I've come to love about it. I'm a big fan of Test Driven Development. I love having conversations about the best practices in asynchronous JS, front-end design trends, and, of course, refactoring.</p>
            <p>I also have a life outside of the screen! Reading, cooking, and music are high on my list of ways I love to spend my time. I don't watch much TV, but I like a good show as much as the next person. I'm currently getting through <em>The Sopranos</em> for the first time. </p>

            <h3>Local Library</h3>
            <p>After my community came together to create a library, I wanted to use JavaScript to help organize our collection. The result is this application, where you can easily find popular books and authors, match account ids to borrowed books, and do so much more!</p>
            <img src="images/decoder-ring.jpg" alt="decoder-ring">
            <h3>Decoder Ring</h3>
            <p>The idea here was to build a nifty application that would encode and decode messages in three different ways. Fun toy to get in a cereal box, hair-puller of a personal project.</p>
            <img src="images/pomodorro-timer.jpg" alt="pomodorro-time">
            <h3>Pomodorro Timer</h3>
            <p>I use the pomodorro technique in my work flow. I started to wonder why I was using the timer on my phone instead of just using an app on the computer. Then I thought, why not just build one myself? I learned quite a lot from this project.</p>
            <img src="images/flash-card-o-matic.jpg" alt="flashcard-o-matic">
            <h3>Flashcard-o-matic</h3>
            <p>Flashcards are probably one of the optimum ways to study, so I wanted to make an app that mimicked them. I think people using this app will find the quality of their studying to be the same, all while saving on paper and time.</p>
