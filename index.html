          <h2>let me build something for you</h2>
          <p>
            i'm a software engineering student at Thinkful learning the full
            stack. i enjoy constantly growing my experience in JavaScript,
            React, and Node, as well as different uses of CSS. i'm located in
            austin, tx.

          <h2>little ol' me</h2>
          <p>
            developing is a constant challenge, and that's what I've come to
            love about it. i'm a big fan of test driven development. I=i love
            having conversations about the best practices in asynchronous JS,
            front-end design trends, and, of course, refactoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            i also have a life outside of the screen! reading, cooking, and
            music are high on the list of ways i love to spend my time. i don't
            watch much TV, but i like a good show as much as the next person.
            i'm currently getting through <em>the sopranos</em> for the first
            time.

        <img src="images/local-library.jpg" alt="library" />
        <h3>local library</h3>
        <p>
          after my community came together to create a library, i wanted to use
          JavaScript to help organize our collection. the result is this
          application, where you can easily find popular books and authors,
          match account ids to borrowed books, and do so much more!

        <h3>decoder ring</h3>
        <p>
          the idea here was to build a nifty application that would encode and
          decode messages in three different ways. fun toy to get in a cereal
          box, hair-puller of a personal project.

        <h3>Pomodorro Timer</h3>
        <p>
          i use the pomodorro technique in my work flow. i started to wonder why
          I was using the timer on my phone instead of just using an app on the
          computer. Then I thought, why not just build one myself? I learned
          quite a lot from this project.

        <h3>Flashcard-o-matic</h3>
        <p>
          flashcards are probably one of the optimum ways to study, so I wanted
          to make an app that mimicked them. i think people using this app will
          find the quality of their studying to be the same, all while saving on
          paper and time.
